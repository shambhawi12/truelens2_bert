# 🔍 Fake News Detector Pro

A machine learning–based project that classifies news articles as Real or Fake.
It uses a trained model and a vectorizer to process the input text and return predictions with high accuracy.

# 📌 Features

1.Data Cleaning – Removes unnecessary content and formats datasets for training.

2.Model Training – Builds and saves a prediction model and vectorizer.

3.Prediction Script – Classifies any given news content as Real or Fake.

4.Streamlit App – Simple user interface for testing news articles.

# 📊 How It Works

1.Data Preparation – Loads and cleans the dataset.

2.Model Training – Trains a classification model and stores it in /model.

3.Prediction – Loads the model and vectorizer to classify new news articles as Real or Fake.

4.User Interface – app.py runs a Streamlit UI for interactive predictions.
